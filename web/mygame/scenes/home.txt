        Putting on your best Fix-It hat, you reluctantly eject your term paper disk and try to stick your pencil into the drive. With a pull on a cable the drive cartwheels across the table and falls to the floor scattering shardes of plastic and metal everywhere.

        You inspect your dot matrix printer and discover the ink ribbon is almost completely shredded. Your cat gives you a guilty look as it shuffles out of the room, trailing little grey paw prints on your carpet.
